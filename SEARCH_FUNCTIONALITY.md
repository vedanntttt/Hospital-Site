- Confirmation required for deletions

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Partial Search**: You don't need to type the full name or phone number
2. **Quick Edit**: Double-click approach - search, edit, save
3. **Date Format**: When editing dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-01-15)
4. **Bulk Operations**: For multiple changes, edit one patient at a time
5. **Data Cleanup**: Use search to find and remove test/invalid data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Slot already taken"**: Choose a different date or time slot
- **"Invalid name"**: Ensure name contains only letters and valid characters
- **"Phone too short"**: Phone number must have at least 10 digits
- **Search not working**: Check if there are any patients matching your search term

### Error Messages
- Clear error messages guide you to fix validation issues
- Success messages confirm when operations complete
